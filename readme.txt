Version: 2.1

Thanks for downloading ViperHUD!
This custom HUD was put together by MrViper (Brennan) from the YouTube channel TFTools.

Installation:
Click the "Download Zip" button down to the right.
Extract the "ViperHUD" folder into the "custom" folder in your TF2 installation.
This will usually be located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom or something very similar.

Be sure to also install the "Gunplay", "Orbitron", and "modernpics" fonts from the "fonts" folder located in the "resource" folder.

The HUD is still a work in progress and is optimized for 1920x1080 resolution,
so if you find something wrong with the HUD or have a suggestion,
you can either tweet at me @mrviper9307 or go to the ViperHUD 2.0 post on r/TFTools and leave a comment.
